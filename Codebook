## Source data: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set


R script : run_analysis.R
In the beginning the data are downloaded and unzipped and the necessary libraries for the analysis are loaded.

Initialize
Download data set
Unzip data set
Load libraries
The 5 steps as described in the course project are followed :

Merge training and test sets to create one data set

Read files
Read training set data, labels, subjects
Read test set data, labels, subjects
Read features data
Read activity labels
Make tidy data frames
Make tidy activity labels: column names
Make tidy train_set: column names and binding with train_labels and subject_train
Make tidy test_set: column names and binding with test_labels and subject_test
Merge tidy training and test sets
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Identify columns with mean and standard deviation
Subset these measurements from tidy_data_set
Add activity_id and subject_id
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names

From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set

with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Make data set
Write data set in txt format
Variables
Input data
train_set : Training set (data from 70% of the volunteers)
train_labels : Training labels
subject_train : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
test_set : Test set (data from 30% of the volunteers)
test_labels : Test labels
subject_test : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
features : List of all features
activity_labels : Links the class labels with their activity name
(features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1])

Output data : average_per_activity_subject.txt
Identifiers
subject_id : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
activity_id : The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
Activity Labels
activity_name: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
