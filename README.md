# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the following 3 files:

- CodeBook.md : describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

- run_analysis.R : the R script for the development of a tidy data set, when following these 5 steps :
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) ses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) rom the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (output: average_per_activity_subject.txt).

- average_per_activity_subject.txt : tidy data set output from step 5
